Muhammad Aqeel N [EP19B027]

Previous experience:
Team member of Raftar for 2 years. 
My roles in Raftar: Accumulator engineer (21-22) and Aerodynamics engineer (20-22). Aerodynamics lead (jan - april 22).

Why I want to be a part of Abhiyaan:
I converted to IDDD robotics this year and I would like to join the team as it is in line with my iddd and future courses. I would be able to use this knowledge to contribute to the team until I graduate. I also feel that my experience working in a cfi team would be of use at Abhiyaan.

Relevant courses:
CS5691 prml (completed)
ID6040 intro to robotics (ongoing)
